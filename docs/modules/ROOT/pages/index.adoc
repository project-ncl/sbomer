Welcome to the SBOMer documentation.

== About

Once a build in Project Newcastle build system (PNC) finishes SBOMer receives a notification about this
fact and the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation process is started automatically.

Generated SBOM is stored in the SBOMer database and a notification
is sent on the xref:user-guide:umb.adoc[UMB] so that other systems will be aware of it.

SBOMs can be fetched from the SBOMer using the xref:user-guide:api/index.adoc[REST API].
