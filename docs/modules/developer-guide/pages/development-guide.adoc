= Development Guide

This page provides help with daily tasks performed by the SBOMer developer.

[NOTE]
====
You should first complete steps described in the xref:environment-setup.adoc[environment setup document].
====

== Note on Environment Targets

TBD

For purpose of daily development we will target the local environment.

== Build SBOMer Images

First, let's build some images that will be used in the development using the `./hack/build-images-minikube.sh`
command.


[source,console]

./hack/build-images-minikube.sh
+ exec ./hack/../mvnw package -DskipTests

+ mkdir -p target
+ minikube -p sbomer image inspect localhost/sbomer-cache:latest
+ popd
----

You will be running this command from time to time, depending on *what parts of the system* you will be changing.
If you change under following directories you will be required to rebuild images:

- `cli/`
- `core/` (most probably)
- `images/` (this one is obvious, I guess)

== Setup SBOMer Using Helm

Please follow link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[upstream documentation] to install Helm.

[source,console]
----
$ helm --kube-context sbomer-local upgrade --install --values https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/project-ncl/sbomer-support/-/raw/main/helm/dev.yaml sbomer ./helm/
Release "sbomer" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: sbomer
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 12 12:27:09 2024
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
----

After some time you should see the `cache` link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment]
ready:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get deployments sbomer-cache
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
sbomer-cache   1/1     1            1           12m
----

As well as the `db` link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSet]:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get statefulsets sbomer-db
NAME        READY   AGE
sbomer-db   1/1     13m
----

Good job!

== Exposing the Database

The database is running in the Kubernetes cluster, but our service will be outside of it.
To make the service work we need to expose the database.

[source,console]
----
$ ./hack/minikube-expose-db.sh
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5432 -> 5432
----

This command will block and hang util you terminate it. The database should be exposed as long
as you run the service.

== Mounting the SBOM Dir

Content generated in SBOMer by the generation tasks needs to be shared with the operator.
Because we run operator outside of the cluster we need to have a way to expose it
to the data running inside of Kubernetes.

We can use the link:https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/mount/[minikube mount] feature.

Prepare a directory on your host which you would like to use for sharing the data. In this example we
will use `$HOME/Projects/sboms/shared`

[source,console]
----
$ minikube -p sbomer mount $HOME/Projects/sboms/shared:/tmp/sbomer --uid=65532
📁  Mounting host path /home/goldmann/Projects/sboms/shared into VM as /tmp/sbomer ...
    ▪ Mount type:   9p
    ▪ User ID:      65532
    ▪ Group ID:     docker
    ▪ Version:      9p2000.L
    ▪ Message Size: 262144
    ▪ Options:      map[]
    ▪ Bind Address: 192.168.39.1:39103
🚀  Userspace file server: ufs starting
✅  Successfully mounted /home/goldmann/Projects/sboms/shared to /tmp/sbomer

📌  NOTE: This process must stay alive for the mount to be accessible ...
----

This command will hang similarly to the one where we exposed the database.

== Running Service in Development Mode

Since we have the database running and exposed, the cache working and the directory shared with minikube host
we can run our service in development mode!

[source,console]
----

== Congratulations!

You have a running service in development mode! You can go straight to the code and make changes. These will be immediately refected
in the running service thanks to link:https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-mode-differences[Quarkus dev mode].

Once you make changes, don't forget to xref:testing.adoc[run tests].

== Running Tests

[source,console]
----
./hack/run-maven.sh clean verify

== Building Images

All images used by this service can be found in the `src/main/images` directory.

[WARNING]
====
Please note that in order to build images you need to be in the *root of the repository*.
====


There are available scripts that help with building all images:

- `./hack/build-images-podman.sh`

  Uses local Podman to build all images.

- `./hack/build-images-docker.sh`

  Uses local Docker to build all images.

- `./hack/build-images-minikube.sh`

  Build images inside of the Minikube environment. This is very useful in case of the `local` development environment
  where you want to test images in a full Kubernetes deployment.

> :arrow_right: Service needs to be built first!
>
> If you don't use above scripts -- please make sure you build the project before building images to ensure the latest
> state of the service is included in the image.
