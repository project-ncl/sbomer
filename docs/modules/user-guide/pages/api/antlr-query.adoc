## REST API Nextgen Query Language (created with ANTLR)


This article serves as a guide to the REST API query language for SBOMer. Note that this language is currently in development and used only by the Nextgen REST API.

## Quick examples

Here are some examples of valid queries to show how the query language looks like:

Query for all entities with a specific ID:

``id = "E0AAAAA"``

Query for all entities that are not of a specific type:

``status != "ERROR"``

Query for all entities that were created before a specific date:

``created < "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"``

Query for all entities that were created after or at a specific date:

``finished > "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"``

Query for all entities using operation LIKE to match a substring in a string field:

``reason ~ "processed"``

Query using AND to combine multiple conditions:

``status = "NEW" AND reason ~ "processed"``

Query using OR to combine multiple conditions:

``status = "NEW" OR reason ~ "processed"``

Query using parentheses to group conditions:

``(id = "E0AAAAA" OR id = "E0BBBBB") AND status = "NEW"``


## Whitespace Handling

The query language is flexible when it comes to whitespace (e.g., spaces and tabs). Any extra whitespace between fields, operators, and values is **ignored** by the parser.

For example, the following queries are all functionally **identical**:
[source,text]
----
id="E0AAAAA"
id = "E0AAAAA"
id      =       "E0AAAAA"
----



:toc: left
:toclevels: 3


## Basic Queries: The Predicate

The most fundamental part of any query is the **predicate**. It's a single condition that checks a field against a value.

.Syntax
[source,text]
----
field_name operator "value"
----

* *field*: The data attribute you want to check (currently supporting values : 'id', 'status', 'created').
* *operator*: The comparison to perform (see the table below).
* *value*: The string you are checking against. **It must always be enclosed in double quotes ("")**.

### Supported Operators

The following table lists all available operators and their meanings.

Note: Not all operators support all field types. For example, `~` (contains) is typically used with string fields, while `>` and `<` are used with numeric or date fields.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Operator | Description
| `=`      | **Equals**: Checks if the field is exactly equal to the value.
| `!=`     | **Not Equals**: Checks if the field is not equal to the value.
| `>`      | **Greater Than**: Checks if the field is numerically or alphabetically greater than the value.
| `<`      | **Less Than**: Checks if the field is numerically or alphabetically less than the value.
| `>=`     | **Greater Than or Equal**: Checks if the field is greater than or equal to the value.
| `\<=`     | **Less Than or Equal**: Checks if the field is less than or equal to the value.
| `~`      | **Contains**: Checks if the field's text includes the value as a substring.
|===

#### Examples of Basic Queries

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
id = "E0AAAAA"

// Find items where the status is NEW
status = "NEW"

// Find items where the status is not ERROR
status != "ERROR"

// Find items where the reason contains the word "processed"
reason ~ "processed"

// Find items with a creation date before Jan 1, 2022
created < "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"
----

## Combining Expressions with `AND` & `OR`

You can create more powerful queries by combining multiple predicates using the logical operators `AND` and `OR`. These operators are **case-insensitive**, so `and` and `or` work as well.

.AND Operator
The `AND` operator requires **all** conditions to be true.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
// Finds items with a status of "NEW" AND a reason containing "Event"
status = "NEW" AND reason ~ "Event"
----

.OR Operator
The `OR` operator requires **at least one** of the conditions to be true.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
// Finds items where the status is "PROCESSED" OR the ID is "E0BBBBB"
status = "PROCESSED" OR id = "E0BBBBB"
----

## Grouping with Parentheses

Use parentheses `()` to group expressions and control the order of evaluation. This is essential when mixing `AND` and `OR` in the same query. Operations inside parentheses are always evaluated first.

.Example of Grouping
[source,subs="quotes"]
----
// Finds items where the status is "NEW" and the ID is either "E0AAAAA" OR "E0BBBBB"
(id = "E0AAAAA" OR id = "E0BBBBB") AND status = "NEW"
----


### Invalid Queries and Common Mistakes

Below are examples of invalid queries, along with explanations of why they will fail. Understanding these common mistakes can help you write valid queries faster.

### Grammar Violations

These queries break the fundamental `field operator "value"` structure of the language.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Invalid Query | Explanation

| `id = E0AAAAA`
| **Missing Quotes**: The value `E0AAAAA` must be enclosed in double quotes, like `"E0AAAAA"`.

| `(id = "E0AAAAA"`
| **Unmatched Parenthesis**: An opening parenthesis `(` was used without a matching closing parenthesis `)`.

| `status =`
| **Missing Value**: The operator `=` is missing a value to its right.

| `status !! "PROCESSED"`
| **Invalid Operator**: The operator `!!` does not exist. A valid operator, like `!=`, must be used.

| `id = "E0AAAAA" AND`
| **Incomplete Expression**: The `AND` operator must be followed by another complete expression (e.g., `status = "NEW"`).

| `"PROCESSED" = status`
| **Incorrect Order**: The query must start with the field name, not the value. The correct order is `status = "PROCESSED"`.
|===

## Semantic Violations

These queries are grammatically correct, but they use operators that are not logically applicable to the specific field.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Invalid Query | Explanation

| `id > "E0AAAAA"`
| **Unsupported Operator for Field**: The `id` field does not support greater-than (`>`) or less-than (`<`) comparisons. It only supports equals (`=`), not-equals (`!=`), or contains (`~`).

| `created ~ "2024"`
| **Unsupported Operator for Field**: The `created` timestamp field does not support the contains (`~`) operator. It should be compared using operators like `>`, `<`, or `=`.
|===

### Invalid Value Formats

These queries use values that don't match the expected data format for a field.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Invalid Query | Explanation

| `updated = "10-25-2023"`
| **Incorrect Date Format**: Timestamp fields expect the ISO 8601 format (e.g., `"2023-10-25T00:00:00Z"`).

| `status="INCORRECT"`
| **Invalid State**: The value `"INCORRECT"` is not a valid choice for the `status` field. It must be one of the predefined values like `"NEW"` or `"PROCESSED"`.
|===

### Unknown Fields

This type of error occurs when the query references a field that does not exist.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Invalid Query | Explanation

| `description = "Some description"`
| **Field Does Not Exist**: The field `description` is not a valid field in the data model and cannot be queried.
|===


## Currently Supported Endpoints

This section details currently supported endpoints and their query capabilities.

### Events `/events`

The following table lists the fields you can use when querying the Events API, along with their data types and example usage.

|===
| Field Name | Data Type | Example Query

| `id`
| String
| `id = "E0BBBBB"`

| `Status`
| **Enum. Must be one of:**
`NEW`, `IGNORED`, `RESOLVING`, `RESOLVED`, `INITIALIZING`, `INITIALIZED`, `PROCESSING`, `PROCESSED`, `ERROR`
| `status != "IGNORED"`

| `created`
| Timestamp
| `created > "2025-07-01T00:00:00Z"`

| `updated`
| Timestamp
| `updated < "2023-12-25T00:00:00Z"`

| `finished`
| Timestamp
| `finished >= "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"`

| `reason`
| String
| `reason ~ "processed"`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
All `String` and `Enum` values **must** be enclosed in double quotes (`""`). Queries like `id = E0AAAAA` are invalid because the value is not quoted. The correct format is `id = "E0AAAAA"`.
====

### Supported Timestamp Formats

Timestamp fields (e.g., `created`, `updated`, `finished`) support multiple formats. When a timezone is not specified, UTC is assumed. Partial dates are parsed from the beginning of the period (e.g., `2023` becomes `2023-01-01T00:00:00Z`).


|===
| Format | Example

| `yyyy`
| `"2023"`

| `yyyy-MM`
| `"2023-10"`

| `yyyy-MM-dd`
| `"2023-10-25"`

| `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`
| `"2023-10-25 14:30"`

| `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`
| `"2023-10-25 14:30:15"`

| ISO 8601
| `"2023-01-01T12:00:00Z"`
