= Generation

Manifest generation is the most important feature of SBOMer.

SBOMer supports manifest generation for multiple different sources for which we have xref:generation/configuration/index.adoc[dedicated configuration].

Generations can be requested manually using the xref:api/index.adoc[REST API] or can be
run automatically as a response to an event from supported services (for example PNC or Errata Tool).

TIP: See examples how you can xref:api/examples.adoc[manually request a generation].
