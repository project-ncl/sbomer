= PNC Build
:config-slug: pnc-build

include::ROOT:partial$wip.adoc[]

This is a special tyle of configuration which covers a Build finished in the PNC build system.

SBOMer is configured to automatically generate manifests for all successfully finished PNC builds.
For such cases, the xref:generators/maven-cyclonedx.adoc[CycloneDX Maven Plugin] generator is used.
SBOMer has the ability to automatically generate the configuration according to the Build metadata.
This includes things like understanding the environment configuration which was used at the build time.
SBOMer tries to be as close as it can be to the original environment in order to ensure high compatiblity
of the generated manifest with the Build itself.

== Properties

=== `buildId`

The PNC build identifier representing the build to manifest.

This property is required for `v1beta1` REST API onwards.

=== `products`

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: pnc-build
products:
  ...
----

It is possible that a single build can generate artifacts that will be released as different
products. For this purpose we have the `products` element which defines a list of products.

In case there is only one product, just add a single product entry to the list.

=== `generator`

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: pnc-build
products:
  - generator:
    ...
----

Generator determines which xref:generators/index.adoc[generator] should be used to generate
the base manifest. In case a generator is not provided, the default xref:generators/maven-cyclonedx.adoc[CycloneDX Maven Plugin] will be used.

WARNING: If you provide this field it is your responsiblity to ensure that the
defined generator can be used for given build.

==== Supported generators

* xref:generators/maven-domino.adoc[]
* xref:generators/maven-cyclonedx.adoc[]
* xref:generators/gradle-cyclonedx.adoc[]


=== `processors`

A list of xref:processors/index.adoc[processors] that should be run after the manifest is generated.

NOTE: The xref:processors/default.adoc[default processor] is always added, you don't need to specify it in the list.

You can add a Red Hat processor that binds given PNC build to a Red Hat product release:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: pnc-build
products:
  - processors:
      - type: redhat-product
        errata:
          productName: "RHBQ"
          productVersion: "RHEL-8-RHBQ-2.13"
          productVariant: "8Base-RHBQ-2.13"
----

You need to make sure you enter correct information. You can find details in the Errata tool
configuration of your product release.

TIP: For available options, please refer to the particular xref:processors/index.adoc[processor] documentation.

== Examples

=== Multi-product configuration

Example of support for multi-product source code repository where a single build (configuration)
in PNC can build more than one product. In the example below have two products defined.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: pnc-build
products:
  - processors:
      - type: redhat-product
        errata:
          productName: "CCCDDD"
          productVersion: "CCDD"
          productVariant: "CD"
    generator:
      type: maven-domino
      args: "--config-file .domino/cccddd.json --warn-on-missing-scm"
      version: "0.0.107"

  - processors:
      - type: redhat-product
        errata:
          productName: "AAABBB"
          productVersion: "AABB"
          productVariant: "AB"
    generator:
      type: maven-domino
      customArgs: "--config-file .domino/aaabbb.json --warn-on-missing-scm"
----

=== Single product configuration

A single product (most common use case) where only the required configuration for the
`redhat-product` processor is provided. For everything else default values are used.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: pnc-build
products:
  - processors:
      - type: redhat-product
        errata:
          productName: "RHBQ"
          productVersion: "RHEL-8-RHBQ-2.13"
          productVariant: "8Base-RHBQ-2.13"
----

== Storing Configuration in a Repository

It is possible to store configuration in a reposiotory so that SBOMer uses it for the manifest generation purpose
instead of a default one (which could be potentially wrong).

In order to make your configuration available to SBOMer you need to commit it into the Git repository
representing the source code used to build the project in PNC. Configuration file should be stored under the `.sbomer/config.yaml`
path.

Once a build is done in PNC, SBOMer will investigate the Git repository (using the tag added by the PNC build system)
to find the configuration file. If it will be available, it will be used.
