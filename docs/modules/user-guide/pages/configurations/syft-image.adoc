= Syft Image
:config-slug: syft-image

In case the `syft-image` configuration is provided, the xref:generators/syft-image.adoc[] generator will be used.

== Elements

=== `paths`

List of paths within the container image that should be used to filter components found by Syft.
If the path to component (for example a JAR file) is located on one of the paths provided in the configuration file
it will be retained. Every component located outsude of given paths will be removed from the manifest.

== Example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: syft-image
paths:
    - "/opt"
----

If we have two components: `/opt/product/content/first.jar` and `/var/lib/product/content/second.jar` detected in the image
we will only add `/opt/product/content/first.jar` to the manifest and the `/var/lib/product/content/second.jar` will be skipped.
