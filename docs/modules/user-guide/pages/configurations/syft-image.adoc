= Syft Image
:config-slug: syft-image

In case the `syft-image` configuration is provided, the xref:generators/syft.adoc[] generator will be used.

== Elements

=== `paths`

List of paths within the container image that should be used to filter components found by Syft.
If the path to component (for example a JAR file) is located on one of the paths provided in the configuration file
it will be retained. Every component located outsude of given paths will be removed from the manifest.

=== `rpms`

A flag whether RPM packages should be added to generated manifest. By default this flag is set to `false` which means
that no RPM packagaes will be added to manifest.

=== `processors`

An array of xref:processors/index.adoc[processors]. The xref:processors/default.adoc[Default] processor is run always. Others are optional.

== Example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: syft-image
paths:
    - "/opt"
----

If we have two components: `/opt/product/content/first.jar` and `/var/lib/product/content/second.jar` detected in the image
we will only add `/opt/product/content/first.jar` to the manifest and the `/var/lib/product/content/second.jar` will be skipped.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: syft-image
rpms: true
paths:
    - "/opt"
----

This example is similar to the above one with one difference: all RPM packages will be added to the manifest.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomer.jboss.org/v1alpha1
type: syft-image
processors:
    - type: default
    - type: redhat-product
      errata:
          productName: pName
          productVersion: pVersion
          productVariant: pVariant
----

This example specifies the xref:processors/index.adoc[processors] that should be run once the manifest is created.
